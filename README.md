# fastapi_apikey

This code repository shows how to use API-key authentication for FastAPI endpoints.

This repository is described in more detail in the Medium article 
[A FastAPI API-key authentication example]().

I have developed this on Windows, but I also cover Linux and macOS differences 
in the Medium article where needed.
